# Oh My CentOS Stream 9

A short tutorial about updating `CentOS 8` / `CentOS Stream 8` to `CentOS Stream 9`

[‰∏≠Êñá](README.md) | [English](README_EN.md)

---

Listen, dude! Did you know? It was December 31st, 2021 that `CentOS 8` reached end of life!  üéâüéâüéâ  
Are you still using `CentOS 8`? Why not update to `CentOS Stream 8`, `Rocky Linux 8` or `AlmaLinux` ?

Wait, don't you hear that `CentOS Stream 9` has already released? There are even `Nodejs16` , `Golang1.17.5`, `kernel5.14` and `glic 2.34` package indexes available!

If you pursue new features and a `dnf` package manager, `CentOS Stream 9` is probably your second best choice! (The first one is still `Fedora`)

But my VPS provider doesn't provide a `CentOS Stream 9` image, or even a `CentOS Stream 8` image, so I have to use an outdated `CentOS 8` image, wouldn't that be bad?

Don't worry, with the method provided in this article, you can also upgrade to `CentOS Stream 9` from `CentOS 8`, with all your data kept and not have to reinstall your system!

## How to use

**WARNING**: Upgrading a major version may cause the software or even the system to fail to operate properly, so please be careful! 

**TIPS**: Please read the whole article before you start the operation. Fell free to open an `issue` when you encounter a problem. If you would like to share a better solution, please submit a `pull request` to help us improve the documention.

### Preparation

Use a backup tool you are familiar with to back up your data. If your service provider supports snapshot capabilities, it is highly recommended that you create a snapshot before proceeding.

### Upgrade from `CentOS 8` to `CentOS Stream 8`

sudo sed -e "s|^mirrorlist=|#mirrorlist=|g" \
         -e "s|^#baseurl=http://mirror.centos.org/\$contentdir/\$releasever|baseurl=https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/centos-vault/$minorver|g" \
         -i.bak \
         /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*.repo

    -y

sudo dnf distro-sync --allowerasing -y

```

### Upgrade from `CentOS Stream 8` to `CentOS Stream 9`

#### 1. Preparing for RPMs

echo "Preparing to download RPMs"
echo "Setting up wget..."
sudo dnf install wget -y

echo "Creating directory ~/cs8to9/el9"
mkdir -p ~/cs8to9/el9
echo "Creating directory ~/cs8to9/epel9"
mkdir -p ~/cs8to9/epel9

echo "Downloading RPMs..."
cd ~/cs8to9/epel9
wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm
wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-next-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm

cd ~/cs8to9/el9
wget http://mirror.stream.centos.org/9-stream/BaseOS/x86_64/os/Packages/centos-stream-release-9.0-22.el9.noarch.rpm
wget http://mirror.stream.centos.org/9-stream/BaseOS/x86_64/os/Packages/centos-stream-repos-9.0-22.el9.noarch.rpm

read -p "Are you sure(y/N)? " -n 1 -r
if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]
then
    echo "yes"
    sudo rpm -e `rpm -q kernel` --nodeps
    sudo rpm -e `rpm -q kernel-devel` --nodeps

sudo dnf reinstall dracut -y
mkdir -p ~/cs8to9/backup
sudo mv /boot/vmlinuz-0-rescue-* ~/cs8to9/backup
sudo mv /boot/initramfs-0-rescue-*.img ~/cs8to9/backup
